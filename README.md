## Project Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the current pandemic outbreak, many countries have implemented social distancing policies in an effort to mitigate the spread of the virus and keep people safe. However, there are still chances that people will get infected even if they adhere to strict social distancing rules. It is urgent that the ones who are infected or who believe they come into close contact with a COVID-19 carrier to self-isolate themselves for at least 14 days. However, it is not always easy to implement contact-tracing. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID-19 aims to support contact-tracing by having users log there activities when they leave their homes to carry out essential daily routine, for instance, grocery shopping, exercising, working, etc. Then, if they get tested, they can update their test records. The application can further process user input and data to determine whether it should notify other users who are within areas with a certain period and raidus of the infected.
